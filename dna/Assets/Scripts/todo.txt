TO DO

turrets:
- need to be able to double up on attacking shark (and prioritize attacking different sharks)
- laser power determined by global efficiency
- upgrade laser power, range
- switch from laser to "bullet" ? (single shot takes out % of health, turret cooldown timer)
- (bug) eventually stops firing
- (bug) sometimes lazer does not render even though the attack is happening

:::: BUGS ::::
- loan button is not re-enabled after loans have been paid off (if maximum # loans were taken out)

:::: GLITCHES ::::


:::: FEATURES ::::

- laborers wander
- can laborers turn into elders now that they are not being assigned tasks?
- show what is currently being built
- fast-forward button (simcity style)
- big spheres for sea
- worker strike when happiness = 0

:::: DESIGN PROBLEMS ::::

- loan shark creation curve (fewer initially, more as debt increases)

:::: HOTKEYS ::::

::: REPRODUCING BUGS :::
- let laborer become elder, then create laborer. the new laborer will try to carry out the tasks of the previous one before it became an elder

:::: BALANCING ::::

:::: CLEANUP ::::
- "lazer" -> "laser"
- "CollectionCenter" -> "Silo"
- "MilkshakePool" -> "Derrick"
- rm unitTransform, unitClickable from Unit (also make unitRenderer private)
- deprecate co.cs and replace with co2.cs (+ rename co2 to co)
- rm old unity projects
- delete old branches
- rm deprecated scripts: RoadConstructor, UnitsList(?), PlotsCreator, Jacuzzi, ProjectionMatrix, CoroutineManager, MonthlyPaymentText, UnitTransform, UnitClickable, MonthTimer

i’m not convinced i’m a good person. i’m not even convinced i’m a person.
i have accepted myself for who i am. i have accepted that i don’t like who i am
what’s important is not what you want to do, but who you want to help
or:
don’t let “what do i want to do with my life?” be a barrier to “who in my life do i want to help?”

going thru doorways erases memories (“WAIT! what was I gonna do in here??”)

time, you washed out
like a soft, sudden, summer rain
