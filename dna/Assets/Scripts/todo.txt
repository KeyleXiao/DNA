time, you washed out
like a soft, sudden, summer rain

to do

going thru doorways erases memories (“WAIT! what was I gonna do in here??”)

:::: bugs ::::

- loan button is not re-enabled after loans have been paid off (if maximum # loans were taken out)
- when a laborer gets to a road construction site and a flower is being grown, it will not perform the task
- ^ in general, laborers performing construction over a growing flower will break

:::: glitches ::::

- if assigning laborer to a point it is already moving towards, the laborer stops

:::: features ::::

demo
- notification when university upgrade finishes
- show # of assigned units above milkshakes, coffee. add option to select all assigned units when resource selected
- show what is currently being built
- fast-forward button (simcity style)

postdemo
- darker blue sea color
- maybe if laborer happiness > 97 after flower construction, just set it to 100 so it doesn’t do the weird quick rotation
- worker strike when happiness = 0

:::: design problems ::::

demo

postdemo
- laborers turning into elders is not fun. you lose development momentum & it’s really hard to pick up steam again.
	> try adding variation to retirement ages so there’s any easier transition

:::: hotkeys ::::

reproducing bugs
- let laborer become elder, then create laborer. the new laborer will try to carry out the tasks of the previous one before it became an elder

:::: balancing ::::
- should be an even random distribution of a *set #* of coffee & milkshakes 

:::: cleanup ::::
- "lazer" -> "laser"
- "CollectionCenter" -> "Silo"
- "MilkshakePool" -> "Derrick"
- rm unitTransform, unitClickable from Unit (also make unitRenderer private)
- deprecate co.cs and replace with co2.cs (+ rename co2 to co)
- rm old unity projects
- delete old branches
- rm deprecated scripts: RoadConstructor, UnitsList(?), PlotsCreator, Jacuzzi, ProjectionMatrix, CoroutineManager

i’m not convinced i’m a good person. i’m not even convinced i’m a person.
i have accepted myself for who i am. i have accepted that i don’t like who i am
what’s important is not what you want to do, but who you want to help
or:
don’t let “what do i want to do with my life?” be a barrier to “who in my life do i want to help?”
