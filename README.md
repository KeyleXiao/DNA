A game about any, all, or none of the following things:
* climate change (1y*)
* geriatrics (4e!)
* milkshakes (0o@)
* link rot & web archiving (1b*)
* sleep (6p&)
* cow shit (2e#)

I'm using Unity to build the game. My approach is to create lots of projects so that experiments are self-contained and as messy as they need to be.
* in general, parts of the game should be created and edited within their own project files (and be their own namespace)
* `base` should contain all working parts & serve as a starting point for new projects
* attempts at making the actual game should be called `v#` (v0, v1, v2, etc)

Anything called "MovableUnit" should be renamed to "MobileUnit"
"Actions" should be renamed to "Tasks"

front load the disaster. everything is a sine wave. you fall into yourself, your giving tree rebirths your population unaltered.
