### or very definitely something else

A game about any, all, or none of the following things:
* climate change
* geriatrics 
* milkshakes 
* link rot & web archiving & anonymous communication
* sleep
* cow shit

I'm using Unity to build the game. My approach is to create lots of projects so that experiments are self-contained and as messy as they need to be.
* in general, parts of the game should be created and edited within their own project files (and be their own namespace)
* `base` should contain all working parts & serve as a starting point for new projects
* attempts at making the actual game should be called `v#` (v0, v1, v2, etc)

Anything called "MovableUnit" should be renamed to "MobileUnit"
"Actions" should be renamed to "Tasks"

front load the disaster. everything is a sine wave. you fall into yourself, your giving tree rebirths your population unaltered.

^an arid strain on a chain. still, it's what's on that's the moment: it's not inherently treasurable to run: except that everything gives something to gain from

## standard trolling exchanges can be an acceptable or interesting-enough compromise when faced w maintaining eye contact w an infinity depthpool
a single unending strand peppered w MFTFH [realistically, probably an exponential qantity dropoff] can not compare to the simple addition of a binary decision: to progress **UP** vs **INSIDE** -----> suddenly we're looking at 2^n instead of 1^n, which knowing 0 math i'm still p sure is a big difference. ok) we're here&now facing a horizontal infinity as well as a vertical infinity, and a messageboardspace begging for the quiet distribution of hidden gems/secrets/jokes/rlly any kind of expression. i mean -> utterly idealistic. it requires a critical mass of players--maybe--or not--after all a space of potential is prob at least as deserving of attention as its more celebrated kinetic counterpart. there's valuable eeriness in something that """can be""" but isn't - and that's justification enough to develop a difficult-for-me concept independent of audience. what grabs me is how the spiritual essence of the game can be dictated/molded by players[#,intention,background, and what they desire/expect from the playexperience--the meddling between the interacted and the interactor--the goal being to >>>penetrate>>> the | creating this abitrary distinction, to be the pruney hands in the water sts]

### what this depends on is a sense of ((un)true) agency, of craft and subsequent sense of ownership found in the forging of ""original"" (who knows? ;)) paths: leans on the varied motivations of ppl: to be a follower, to follow, to want to be followed, to want not to be found: to birth unsupervised challenges for oneself & for others, while the traditionally understood game itself chugs along in seeming independence
:wq

w ofc all this only in the end just being my own MFTFH, probs wrong, probs untickling, nearsighted and stillborn :: that's ok - the only Strongly Held Belief i'm hoping to express is

+ all blooming flowers from clay pots arranged pentagonally. all blooming flowers are functions of production. the church of consumption/work revered/how defined a persons' worth. the preference for tangibility: the lazy/easy expression of realness by physical things ..
+ fortunately this is all suffusable (and is always being suffused, after all - though it [the suffusion] does not feel the compulsion for an obviously convincing case) here & then, near & now, etc.

async communication btw 5 randomly assigned peers (peers never change unless someone quits, then the game introduces another player to the peer group? [anyays - - the idea is that 1 player (**A**) has 4 peers, but each of those peers has their own group containing 3 other peers that **A** doesn't know about (i'm awful at describing this even though it should be easy to explain but the point is that - - everyone's connected, but connections are contained [final disclaimer that this may also only be an idea i enjoy conceptually but which might be too monumental a task to implement & balance & which the unpredictable nature of which might make for a too-chaotic or too-rigid system to be meaningful --- basically it has to be at least as fun as it is frustrating (& vv)])])

the 5 peers are a static group until someone quits, wins, or loses, and then a newb enters as a replacement | the teams persist, but the people in them change | i'm trying to figure out how peers affect one another. this is esp important bc, eh, it's the whole point of the game::: balancing personal achievement w/ the good of the community -> selfishness is rewarded (and, crucially, needs to be ingame desirable) but has consequences for all other players::: a team of only selfish players will certainly lose

what's important here is that the a to the q of **'how to win this game?'** is obvious - collaboration & self sacrifice - but the obstacle is that dialogue btwn players is obscured (the particulars of which i'm not sure about just yet). but basically players only have an opportunity to leave MFTFH upon the Upward or Inward Dive, and the """strength""" / """outreach""" of those messages is determined by how venerated were the Passing Elders

### The Upward or Inward Dive & the veneration of Passing Elders
is the playspace heartbeat is the bar w/ a repeat is the motif is the time&space of little interaction which at the end of emerge rebirthed players on a new familiar mission. this is guaranteed to happen and happens in 1 of 2 ways: Upward or Inward, with the direction being determined by 'how venerated were the Passing Elders' -> to respect & care for aged laborers & to pass properly souls to the Recycler is an economic burden (but a scaling burden, the "cost" of which is determined by the player's society's attachment to/obssession with/reliance on material goods ofc) but is more spiritually rewarding : The Inward Dive is claustrophobic and confines the player to their **Gigantic Giving Tree**, while the Upward Dive reveals the **universe of giving trees** - is more moldable - more malleable. trouble here is that this is bifurcated, simplistic, with a too-obviously "right" answer - so i need to work on that
