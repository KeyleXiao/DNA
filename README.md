### or very definitely something else

A game about any, all, or none of the following things:
* climate change (1y*)
* geriatrics (4e!)
* milkshakes (0o@)
* link rot & web archiving (1b*)
* sleep (6p&)
* cow shit (2e#)

I'm using Unity to build the game. My approach is to create lots of projects so that experiments are self-contained and as messy as they need to be.
* in general, parts of the game should be created and edited within their own project files (and be their own namespace)
* `base` should contain all working parts & serve as a starting point for new projects
* attempts at making the actual game should be called `v#` (v0, v1, v2, etc)

Anything called "MovableUnit" should be renamed to "MobileUnit"
"Actions" should be renamed to "Tasks"

front load the disaster. everything is a sine wave. you fall into yourself, your giving tree rebirths your population unaltered.

^an arid strain on a chain. still, it's what's on that's the moment: it's not inherently treasurable to run: except that everything gives something to gain from

## standard trolling exchanges can be an acceptable or interesting-enough compromise when faced w maintaining eye contact w an infinity depthpool
a single unending strand peppered w MFTFH [realistically, probably an exponential qantity dropoff] can not compare to the simple addition of a binary decision: to progress **UP** vs **INSIDE** -----> suddenly we're looking at 2^n instead of 1^n, which knowing 0 math i'm still p sure is a big difference. ok) we're here&now facing a horizontal infinity as well as a vertical infinity, and a messageboardspace begging for the quiet distribution of hidden gems/secrets/jokes/rlly any kind of expression. i mean -> utterly idealistic. it requires a critical mass of players--maybe--or not--after all a space of potential is prob at least as deserving of attention as its more celebrated kinetic counterpart. there's valuable eeriness in something that """can be""" but isn't - and that's justification enough to develop a difficult-for-me concept independent of audience. what grabs me is how the spiritual essence of the game can be dictated/molded by players[#,intention,background, and what they desire/expect from the playexperience--the meddling between the interacted and the interactor--the goal being to >>>penetrate>>> the | creating this abitrary distinction, to be the pruney hands in the water sts]

### what this depends on is a sense of ((un)true) agency, of craft and subsequent sense of ownership found in the forging of ""original"" (who knows? ;)) paths: leans on the varied motivations of ppl: to be a follower, to follow, to want to be followed, to want not to be found: to birth unsupervised challenges for oneself & for others, while the traditionally understood game itself chugs along in seeming independence
:wq

w ofc all this only in the end just being my own MFTFH, probs wrong, probs untickling, nearsighted and stillborn :: that's ok - the only Strongly Held Belief i'm hoping to express is

:wq
