# DNA (working title of freaking course)

* in general, parts of the game should be created and edited within their own project files (and be their own namespace)
* `base` should contain all working parts & serve as a starting point for new projects
* attempts at making the actual game should be called `v#` (v0, v1, v2, etc)
