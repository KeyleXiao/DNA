-figure 8 pattern & encircling static units\
-\'93drop on and circle\'94 for certain units (jacuzzi, clinic)\
-mobile units stop transferring after receiving inventory filled (e.g. when building a plot & the laborer has leftover milkshakes)\
-laborers don\'92t path between units that don\'92t share an action (e.g. coffee plant and milkshake derrick) \'97 don\'92t allow the path in the first place\
-distinguish enabling/disabling action from activating/deactivating action\
-laborers don\'92t collect milkshakes if paired with an empty plot\
-ability to cancel building projects by clicking on this^ indicator\
-slow laborers max speed\
-action performers need to be able to consume 1 inventory item while generating others (a trading action) (e.g. clinic require coffee to treat elders) >> or not- this might be confusing to play, and it\'92s more illustrative to have resources only go into building units (so, coffee plants die and milkshake derricks have a finite supply of milkshakes, and clinics are expensive to build)\
-must deliver constant stream of milkshakes to jacuzzis; must deliver constant stream of coffee to clinics\
-laborer capacity for jacuzzi (like clinic)\
-drop off finished laborers/remains\
-don\'92t allow milkshake derrick to be depleted if not enough milkshakes to build another derrick OR: populate map with set # of derricks & set milkshakes at a finite amount (like gold or rock in age of empires) <- this might be a lot better since it also gives 1 less building option to the player\
-double click laborer to follow\
-laborer happiness indicator\
-interrupting laborers during transfer messes up inventory\
-be able to set action times specific to the unit (e.g. years w/ corpse vs years w/ coffee plant)\
\
balancing:\
-lose happiness quicker\
-elders lose health faster (the feeling needs to be\'97 i need to keep them alive longer!! rather than \'93when will they die??\'94\
-higher year requirement on giving tree\
\
eventually:\
-replace current object pool with object pool from rbf game\
\
\
when are actions enabled/disabled? when are they activated/deactivated?\
- any object implementing IActionPerformer or IActionAcceptor can activate or deactivate actions. ONLY the implementer may do this - not the action list\
\
- ONLY the action list checks for enabled/disabled actions\
- actions themselves determine whether they are enabled/disabled - this is not set by the action list. this replaces accept/perform conditions\
-action checks its enabled state EVERY TIME before it is performed}
