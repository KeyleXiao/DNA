\f0\fs48 \cf0 julia was the first person i ever fell in love with and it was because she loved me. the moment i know she was in love with me was when we stayed up til 4 in the middle of the week dancing & screaming to kate bush, mimicking to the best of our abilities the unfettered braying that ends the dreaming. we were loud and obnoxious, neighbors normal people complain about - but when she took me and she put me inside her everything shifted. she looked seriously at my sweaty face and we kissed and she touched me so delicately i had to imagine what it felt like. \

julia was also older and wiser than me. she\'92d say you have to accept whatever comes to you, and especially what doesn\'92t. she\'92d say god\'92s a secret to herself. she\'92d say a problem ignored becomes a problem unignorable.}
