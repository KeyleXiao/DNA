\f0\fs24 \cf0 two angels pricked on corners of clean linen appear as dots from the crowd of believers singing from below. in cadence i ask my father why we are here and he points his body from one angel to the other and explains how these two will ski down to the center, cross paths, and weave their way down to meet us. they will bow. we will cheer. i\'92m thinking of clementines, samichlaus and schmutzlis when the two angels, plucked from clean linen collide on climax and fight for each other\'92s life as the piece resolves.}
